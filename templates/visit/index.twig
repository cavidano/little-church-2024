							We love to have visitors. Every Sunday sees a stream of visitors who come here to photograph the stained-glass windows, wander through the nooks and crannies, and discover the unexpected, such as the actor Rex Harrisonâ€™s memorial plaque placed next to a Madonna window. Some come for a guided tour and listen to the story of how we came to be called the "Little Church Around the Corner." Others come to carry out research on our various art and artifacts or their personal connections.
						</p>
